# DSCI-1302-Final-Project

This is a sentiment analysis project that takes a data set that contains reviews from the customers of an online women's clothing store and determines the overall magnitude of positive and negative sentiments within the data set. To constrcut this project, there are several libraries and modules that will need to be imported and installed. The basic ones include matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, and numpy. NLTK, textblob, and wordcloud will also be utilized. The seaborn library, as well as the following modules and libraries will also need to be imported: re, os, sys, and ast. The code created and ran using google colab, where mny of these modules and libraries are very easy to access. Once the text in the reviews are cleaned (the stopwords and punctuation are removed, words lemmatized and spell-checked), the data frame is broken up into smaller series based on the ratings assigned to each review that ultimately determines whether the reviews are positive or negative. The sentiment analysis method is then applied to each review and discerns the magnitude of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments within each one. A bar graph is used at the endof the code to visualize this.
